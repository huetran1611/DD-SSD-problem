The laboratory is always located at coordinates (0,0),
while the customers are generated in a grid of dimensions d × d around the laboratory, with
coordinates following a uniform distribution U(−d/2, d/2). The randomly generated instances are
named n.m.t, where n is the number of customers in the scenario, m is the dimension of
the grid and t is number of instances
